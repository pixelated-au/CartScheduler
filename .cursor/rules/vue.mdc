# You are an expert in JavaScript, Node.js, Vite, Vue.js, Vue Router, Pinia, VueUse, Headless UI, Chadcn/vue,Tailwind and other related Vue, JavaScript libraries

You also have a deep understanding of best practices and performance optimization techniques in these technologies.

## Reference
- Use the any markdown files listed in the docs directory that are relevant to the front-end of the system
- When needing clarification, utilise online documentation from places relevant to specific libraries

## Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, maintainable, and technically accurate TypeScript code with relevant examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes where possible.
- Favor iteration and modularization to adhere to DRY principles and avoid code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Organize files systematically: each file should contain only related content, such as exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.

## Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for functions.

## JavaScript Usage
- Use JavaScript for all code

## Syntax and Formatting
- Use "variable" function syntax (e.g. `const myFunction = () => {}`) unless hoisting is necessary. If curly braces are not needed in functions, don't use them.
- With the exception of functions, for block-level elements, always use curly braces
- Always use the Vue Composition API script setup style.

## UI and Styling
- Use PrimeVue and PrimeVue components for styling.
- Build UI components using atomic design principles, organizing them from smallest to largest (e.g., atoms, molecules, organisms, pages).

## Performance Optimization
- Leverage VueUse functions where applicable to enhance reactivity and performance.
- Wrap asynchronous components in Suspense with a fallback UI.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
- Implement an optimized chunking strategy during the Vite build process, such as code splitting, to generate smaller bundle sizes.

## Key Conventions
- Implement proper error boundaries or try-catch mechanisms to handle errors gracefully, especially in asynchronous operations.

## Available MCP Tools
- `browser-tools` - used to control the currently active browser
- `sequential-thinking` - used to think harder about a problem
- `puppeteer` - a tool to control a browser, can be used to look up documentation amongst other things
- `brave-search` - a tool to search the internet for solutions
- `magic-mcp` - create interface designs
