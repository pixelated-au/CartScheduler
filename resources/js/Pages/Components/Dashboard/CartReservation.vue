      Mobile: a snap carousel, so the two views can be swiped between. The browser
      owns the gesture, the axis locking and the momentum; all this component does
      is settle the state afterwards. `overflow-y-hidden` is required — setting
      one axis to `auto` makes the other compute to `auto` too, which would give
      the track a scroller of its own and take the scrolling off the page again.
      It also clips the off-screen pane when it is the taller of the two.

      `items-start` stops the panes stretching to the track, so each keeps its own
      content height and can be measured; the height below is then the active
      pane's. Without it the two would size to each other and the measurement
      would just read back whatever it last wrote.

      `-mx-4` hands the shell's page margin to the panes: the track spans the full
      width, so each pane does too, and each lays that margin back inside itself.
      Mid-swipe the two margins meet and read as the same gutter a `gap` used to
      draw, and — the point of the exercise — a pane's own scroller can now reach
      the window edge, where its scrollbar belongs. Reaching from inside a pane
      instead would put the bar past the scrollport, which simply hides it.

      Desktop: the panes collapse to `contents` and the track is the same
      single-cell grid as before, where `grid-rows-1` is minmax(0, 1fr) so the
      active view gets exactly the available height rather than being sized by its
      own content.
